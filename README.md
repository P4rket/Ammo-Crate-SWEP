# Ammo-Crate-SWEP
This addon adds a portable ammo crate that replenishes your ammunition based on the weapon you're holding. It works best with weapons using standard ammo types but will also resupply custom ammo from other addons.

# What you might be want to change:

Speed of recharge (lines 29-39 of weapon_ammo_kit.lua)\
Ammo limits (lines 25-35 of entity_ammo_crate.lua)\
Crate ground lifetime (line 19 of entity_ammo_crate.lua)

Feel free to make additions or changes and reupload in workshop
